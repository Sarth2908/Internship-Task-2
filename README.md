# Internship-Task-2
The email is regarding the verification of email from the organization named as GoDaady. 
GoDaddy is the company which provides the domains for the websites.
The sender tries the spear phishing technique so that the target gets panic and take the wrong step.
The attacker is using the social engineering technique in the body of messege that shows the urgency to verify the email and if fail to do so, the domain will be on hold.
The link is embeded in VERIFY THE EMAIL button so that it will redirect to the destination page.
Header is also fake and the email address is also fake one like - "godaddy@bigdogdomains.co"
There is minimal grammatical mistakes so the chances of attack will be high.
